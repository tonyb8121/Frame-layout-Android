# Frame-layout-Android
A simple Android application  that demonstrates various concepts of Frame Layout. 

Explanation of Concepts
Frame Layout: The app uses a Frame Layout to stack the ImageView, TextView, and Button. The last added view (Button) appears on top of the others.

Child Views:

ImageView: Displays an image that fills the entire screen.

TextView: Displays a welcome message centered on the screen.

Button: Positioned at the bottom center of the screen, allowing user interaction.

Layout Gravity: The layout_gravity attribute is used to position the TextView in the center and the Button at the bottom center of the Frame Layout.

Dynamic Changes: The app demonstrates how to change the content of the ImageView and TextView dynamically when the button is clicked.

Event Handling: The OnClickListener is used to handle button clicks, showcasing how to interact with UI elements in Android.

Build and run the app. You should see the initial image and text. Clicking the button will change the image and text displayed.
